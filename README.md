# docker/docker-install
Home of the script that lives at `get.docker.com` and `test.docker.com`!

The purpose of the install script is for a convenience for quickly
installing the latest Docker-CE releases on the supported linux
distros. It is not recommended to depend on this script for deployment
to production systems. For more thorough instructions for installing
on the supported distros, see the [install
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
